# easyaccept
EasyAccept is a tool developed to help development teams create acceptance tests in Java. Such tests are black box and aim to capture the functional requirements for a software system as expressed by a client. A client is typically a non-IT person with a need to be solved through a software system. EasyAccept is being developed with the following requirements in mind:  It should be easy for a client to write acceptance tests him or herself. Since knowing what to test needs some training (e.g. to test limit conditions, etc.), this task will usually be performed together with an experienced software person. Even if a software person helps a client to write tests, the client must be able to thoroughly understand the written tests without any help (after learning a bit about test language syntax). EasyAccept should be reasonably easy to retrofit into existing software, as long as business logic has been separated from user interface considerations in the software to be tested. It should be easy to automate the execution of acceptance tests. It should be easy to test error conditions and non-error conditions.
